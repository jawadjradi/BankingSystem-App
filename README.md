# Banking System in Java

## Overview
This is a simple **Banking System** implemented in Java. It allows users to register, log in, deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and view their transaction history. The system uses **SHA-256 hashing** for password security and provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

## Features
- **User Registration & Authentication** (Password hashing with SHA-256)
- **Deposit & Withdrawal**
- **Money Transfer** between users
- **Transaction History** tracking
- **Balance Inquiry**
- **Secure Storage** of user credentials

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 21)
- SHA-256 for password hashing
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Install [Java JDK 21](https://jdk.java.net/)
- Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or any Java IDE

### Steps

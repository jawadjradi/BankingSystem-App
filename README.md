# Banking System in Java

## Overview
A secure banking system implemented in **Java** using **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **AES encryption** for secure transactions. The system allows users to perform banking operations, such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checks, while ensuring secure communication through encryption.

## Features
- **User Registration & Authentication** (Password hashing with SHA-256)
- **Deposit & Withdrawal**
- **Money Transfer** between users
- **Transaction History** tracking
- **Balance Inquiry**
- **Secure Storage** of user credentials
- **GUI**: The system features an easy-to-use **JavaFX-based GUI** for better user interaction.
- 
## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 21)
- SHA-256 for password hashing
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)
